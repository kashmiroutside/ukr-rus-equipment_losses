## Why
When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, I was devastated. After the initial shock wore off I became obsessed with trying to help Ukraine. I researched organizations and donated as much as I could, but I wanted to do more. When I discovered Oryx, I decided my limited skills in data analysis and visualization might be put to good use.
